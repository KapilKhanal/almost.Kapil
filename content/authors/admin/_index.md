# Breaking the ice
Hello, glad you found this blog. I write about data, code, mathematics and policy/social/sports analytics realted data analysis. Let's have a conversation.  :coffee: or :beers: on me :hand: !  <br>

I am an undergrad at Winona State University, Winona, a <a href = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwie2eCfhtHkAhVwJTQIHeG6DxUQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fkylekotajarvi%2F6894501926&psig=AOvVaw0QuEJbIhL4UgFjyO3wqzDH&ust=1568575761020272">beautiful place</a> in midwest. 

You can usually find me talking about data,statistics, programming, machine learning and tech for good. Other than that, I play :soccer: , ping-pong, hike and binge watch TV shows.Sometime, I ponder whether or not the world is a collection of dataset with a very complicated, time dependent schema.

I strive to improve my technical skills by reading books, tinkering with code and trying out new tools.

If you want to have a glance at my coding profile in github. Here is a dashboard at <a href="https://sourcerer.io/kapilkhanal">**Sourcerer**</a>

Also, I am looking for opportunities related to Data science , Machine learning and Database ecosystem. I am looking for teams that promotes collaboration, self learning and professional development.
