# Breaking the ice
Hello, Glad you found this blog. I write about Data,Code and Mathematics. Let's have a conversation. Coffee or Ice Cream on Me ! Let's nerd out with data and machine learning systems.<br>
I am an undergrad at Winona State University. You can usually find me talking about data , visualization and programming. Other than that, I play soccer , ping-pong and binge watch TV shows.This blog almosts mirror me but *not* completely. 
I also try to write gist of classical stat/ML research papers here: https://kapil-khanal.gitbook.io/blogging-as-book/
