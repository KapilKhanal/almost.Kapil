This project looks at how can the introduction of a discount during the holidays affect the total sale of customer groups within a timeframe of a year. The statistical techniques used are:

RFM analysis (recency, frenquency, monetary) to analyse customer behavior by examining their transaction history such as,

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)
RFM helps us identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions.

K-means to segment customers into various category groups.

Causal impact analysis to study the impact of discounts within each customer group
