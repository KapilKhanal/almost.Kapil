`Introduction`:<br>
This Project addresses the need of communication of public school data to community members in an meaningful way.Also, making the data available to general public in a proper and useable format. <br>

Primarily, this Project was focused on cleaning and visualizing the Enrollment,Expenditures and Staffing History reports of the Winona Area Public District(WAPS) available publicly through Minnesota department of education, Data Center

<h5>Methods and Steps of Projects</h5>.
1)Data Inspection/Acquisition:.<br>
 Data was made available by Allison Quam(Representative from WAPS District).
 The Data were made available in different pdf/excel files. Also, the information were       scattered in different files.<br>

2)Data Cleaning and Formatting<br>
First,most of the pdf files were converted to excel by Tabula(Link:http://tabula.technology/) and online tool(http://pdftoexcel.com)
then, they were cleaned up in proper format and stacked using Python (Pandas).<br>

3)Data Exploration and Visualization <br>
This part of the project is focused on addressing the questions provided by representative of WAPS(`Allison Quam` ). 
Tableau was used extensively to explore the data and visualize it.
Primarily, i focused on answering following questions.<br>
 1. <span style="color:purple">**I was curious about,how does the enrollment and capture rate(rate of new born enrolling to Kindergarten)is changing on WAPS district?.** </span><br>
 
After few meetings with representative, i knew she was curious about how schools spends on across different programs.<br>
 
2.<span style="color:purple">**How the expenditure per average daily membership (count of student daily served in schools)  and spending on various category is changing?.</span>**<br>

#### Acknowledgement
