<h5>
Methods and Steps of Projects
</h5>
<p>.
1)Data Inspection/Acquisition:.<br>
Data was made available by Allison Quam(Representative from WAPS District).
The Data were made available in different pdf/excel files. Also, the information were scattered in different files.<br></p>
<p>2)Data Cleaning and Formatting<br>
First,most of the pdf files were converted to excel by Tabula(Link:<a href="http://tabula.technology/" class="uri">http://tabula.technology/</a>) and online tool(<a href="http://pdftoexcel.com" class="uri">http://pdftoexcel.com</a>)
then, they were cleaned up in proper format and stacked using Python (Pandas).<br></p>
<p>3)Data Exploration and Visualization <br>
This part of the project is focused on addressing the questions provided by representative of WAPS(<code>Allison Quam</code> ).
Tableau was used extensively to explore the data and visualize it.
Primarily, i focused on answering following questions:<br>
a)First,i was curious about,how does the enrollment and capture rate(rate of new born enrolling to Kindergarten)is changing on WAPS district? <br>
After few meetings with representative, i knew she was curious about how schools spends on across different programs.<br>
b)How the expenditure per average daily membership (count of student daily served in schools) and spending on various category is changing?<br></p>
