<h3>My First Project at CMU Statistics :Sport Analytics Camp</h3>
<p>Here is the schedule of this summer camp.</p>
<p>The first week has been a good review of basic dplyr syntax and ggplot2 philosophy. I like how Professors and TA are always there for us. Small data manipulation problems or points being masked in scatterplots, i ran into all sort of problems. <br>
These are a practice projects before we actually work with our choice of research projects.</p>
<p>Here is the schedule of this summer camp.

<h6>Project 3:Simulating Office Environment in Analytics <br></h6>
<p>This is a non-technical project but most fun project. Our class of 16 students were partitioned into 4 analytics department for a hypothetical team. There is a lot of romour on players market, where some players are up for grab who are extremely essential for our team. Also, we have to let go some players. The crazy part of this project is that time is ticking. Our boss changes her decision every few minutes as per the changes inmarket. We have to come up with a some numbers to back up some decisions we are about to recommend.</p>
<p>Below is the slide we prepared within 10 minutes with so many factora being changed while we were working on it.

<p>This project shed some light on the life of working data scientists and data analysts. Itâ€™s not always about fancy graphs or complicated tongue twisting models. I learned that we start with the problem we have, collect necessary data, make new metrics as per problem, graph problems and proposed solutions so that intuitive to all concerned parties and then use models to test our hypothesis and take decision.</p>

<h3>Project 3:</h3>
<p>This is the final project i worked on for the half of this summer camp. We were presented a lot of research projects. I chose this because soccer has been very interesting for me from my childhood. I played soccer in my high school extensively and it still fascinates me with all the complexity involved from Math ,Statistical and data point of view.</p>
